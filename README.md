# dodici
Play Dodici against an optimal opponent.

In Dodici, there is a total that starts from 0, and in each turn you may choose to increment the counter by 1, 2, or 3. You and CorboBot share this total and these options, and whichever of you increments the counter to or over 12 loses the game.

CorboBot plays this game optimally, though, as the player starts first, it is possible to beat CorboBot if you also play optimally.

This game is inspired by a primary school game by Signora Corbo to teach kids numbers in Italian, so be careful, Corbo has been playing this game for a long time and is very good at it.
